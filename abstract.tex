\textbf{Motivation:}
Major advances have been made in the assembly of complex genomes such as wheat. Remaining challenges
include linking these new resources to legacy research, as well as lowering the bar to entry for
members of the research community who may lack specific bioinformatics skills. 
\\
\textbf{Results:} 
Pretzel aims to solve these problems by providing an interactive, online environment for data visualisation and analysis which, when loaded with appropriately curated data, can enable researchers with no bioinformatics training to exploit the latest genomic resources. 
We demonstrate that Pretzel can be used to answer common questions asked by researchers as well as for advanced curation of pseudomolecule structure.
